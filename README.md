# SpriteAnimation-Monogame

Will update this but for now. This Sprite animation use a different apporach to other one that I have seen where instead of using a sprite sheet, it takes in an array of Texture2D and update them accordingly
There are currently two cs files that u need to import and use which are both in the SpriteAnimation folder

Currently for testing the sample, you can clone the repo

cd SpriteAnimation-Monogame

run dotnet run Program.cs

and for controlling the player,

right arrow for the running loop

space for triggering attack anim

D keys for triggering death animation

The asset that this example use is here https://sventhole.itch.io/hero-knight
