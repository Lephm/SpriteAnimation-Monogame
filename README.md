# SpriteAnimation-Monogame

Will update this but for now. This Sprite animation use a different apporach to other one that I have seen where instead of using a sprite sheet, it takes in an array of Texture2D and update them accordingly
There are currently two cs files that u need to import and use which are both in the SpriteAnimation folder
